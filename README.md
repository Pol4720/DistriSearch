# DistriSearch

DistriSearch is a distributed file search system developed as the **final project for the Distributed Systems course (4th year, Computer Science degree)**.  

Unlike traditional search engines, DistriSearch allows every node in the network to both **contribute files** and **query the system**. Each computer that joins the system becomes part of a distributed architecture, enabling collaborative search and access to documents across the network.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Distributed Architecture:** no central server; every node acts as both client and provider.  
- **File Discovery:** search files by name and type across all connected machines.  
- **Resilience:** system tolerates node departures without causing failures or inconsistencies.  
- **Duplication Handling:** manages duplicate files efficiently, selecting the best source for transfer.  
- **Fault-Tolerant Transfers:** supports error handling if a file becomes unavailable during access.  
- **Efficiency:** optimized search mechanisms to minimize response time for users.  

## 📚 Project Context
This project was designed as part of the *Distributed Systems* course, 4th year of the Computer Science degree.  
It demonstrates practical application of distributed computing concepts such as **fault tolerance, replication, peer-to-peer communication, and efficiency in search algorithms**.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Support for richer metadata-based search (e.g., keywords, size, creation date).  
- Enhanced fault tolerance with replication strategies.  
- Integration of semantic search capabilities.  
- Web-based UI for easier interaction.
